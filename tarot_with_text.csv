 theories of those whom Papus rebuked were in better accord than he with the true facts of the matter.

Key symbols to the ace of wands Tarot card meanings

Clouds: Symbol meaning of clouds deal with ambiguity, mystery, and things hidden. Most renditions of this card depict a hand holding a flaming torch thrust out suddenly from the clouds. This is symbolic of our ideas or energy coming out of the hidden places of our psyche and into the light of day. Clouds often deal with hidden agendas that might be keeping us in a holding pattern. They may also indicate underlying beliefs that hold us back from our being our brightest selves.


Rivers: River symbol meanings deal with motion, direction, and the flow of our thoughts as well as our lives. When the river in the ace of wands Tarot card flows into our psychic vision it is a message that we must consider the direction we are taking in our lives. Specifically, since the ace of wands deals with passion and energy, we may want to consider where our actions are taking us. Take the time to reassess one's goals and be confident one is heading in the life direction desired.


Mountains: Symbol meanings of mountains deal with challenges, acquisition, accomplishment and aspirations. Mountains are a symbolic allegory for us in that as we climb them, each step brings us closer to our highest point. This highest point, the top of the mountain, can be a spiritual goal, physical goal, or anything else that we aspire to reach. The mountain is unbending, and inflexible. This makes it a reminder that only we can change how we deal with challenges (because the mountain certainly isn't going to change for us). This being the case, we can embrace the lessons we gain as we take on the challenge of the mountain. We can also rest assured that the peak will always be there as we aspire ever higher to our desired results.

it is a purely active force. It is ruled also by Saturn and Leo. Leo shows the
element of Fire at its strongest and most balanced. Saturn tends to weigh it
down and to embitter it. There is no limit to the scope of this volcanic energy.

is derived from the superiors; were it not so, this card would be thoroughly
disastrous. Moreover, there are also two wands of the Second, or Major Adept.
They have the head of the Phoenix, which gives the idea of destruction (or
rather purgation) through fire, and the resurrection of the energy from its

from the person's too great selfishness at the beginning. Illwill,
levity, lying, malice, slander, envy, obstinacy; swiftness

and self-sacrifice, when well dignified.

“The number Ten refers to Malkuth, which depends from the other nine
Sephiroth, but is not directly in communication with them. It shows the Force
detached from its spiritual sources. It is become a blind Force; so, the most
violent form of that particular energy, without any modifying influences. The
flames in the back ground of the card have run wild. It is Fire in its most
destructive aspect.

The card also refers to the influence of Saturn in Sagittarius. Here is the
greatest antipathy. Sagittarius is spiritual, swift, light, elusive, and luminous;
Saturn is material, slow, heavy, obstinate, and obscure.

The eight Wands are still crossed, showing the enormous power of the
completed energies of Fire; but they have lost their patents of nobility. Their
ends seem more like claws; they lack the authority and intelligence shown in
the earlier cards; and in front are the two formidable Dorjes of the Two of

The whole picture suggests Oppression and repression. It is a stupid and

As a symbol of possibility in the area of deep feelings, intimacy, attunement, compassion and love, in divination, it shows that a seed of emotional awareness has been planted in your life, though you may not yet recognize it. When the seed sprouts, it could take almost any form. It might be an attraction, strong feeling, intuitive knowing, or sympathetic reaction. On the outside, it could be an offer, gift, opportunity, encounter, or synchronistic event.

This Ace requires the diviner to examine their life to see how creating 

 works there. This card often means that love is the essence of the situation, the heart of the matter. It may or may not be romantic love, and can depend on other cards around it. The inquirer may be guided to look for ways to connect with others at this level: is there someone to forgive, or is forgiveness even needed? Can anger be replaced with peace, division replaced with empathy? Is it necessary to let feelings show? Shared or kept secret, The Ace of Cups always indicates ""your time"" is coming or may be arriving presently.

This card also suggests inner attunement and spirituality. Cups are the suit of the 

, and the Ace stands for the direct knowing that comes from the heart. Suggestions for interpretation include: ""Trust what your feelings are telling you,"" ""Seek out ways to explore your consciousness, seek out paths that lead to your connections with Spirit,"" ""Allow the power of your emotions to guide you in a new direction,"" and ""Embrace the love that is the Ace of Cups.""

According to one source, these are five key meanings associated with the Ace of Cups:

The Ace of Cups represents issues of love, intimacy, deeper feelings, and compassion. It announces the new beginning of great possibility in this area of life. It can mark the start of a new relationship, or a deeper connection to an existing one. While this may be a romantic relationship, it can also signify a friendship. A seed has been planted and once it sprouts, it can take almost any form, from an attraction to an intuitive knowing. Trust in the feelings that are present. Furthermore, this card can signify a gift or opportunity. An offer may be forthcoming. If this card appears on a reading where a reader wants to understand a timeline for any situation, an ace of cup symbolizes a duration of one week. Reversed, this card indicates that the creation of a deeper connection to another is being blocked. This can be due to circumstances or because of a

A White Radiant Hand, issuant from the lower part of
the card from a cloud, holds lotuses. A lotus flower rises 

above water, which occupies the lower part of the card rising
above the hand. From this flower rises a stem, terminating
near the top of the card in another lotus, from which flows a
sparkling white water, as from a fountain. Crossed on the
stem just beneath are two dolphins, Argent and Or, on to
which the water falls, and from which it pours in full streams,
like jets of gold and silver, into two cups; which in their turn
overflow, flooding the lower part of the card. Venus and Cancer above
and below.
Harmony of masculine and feminine united. Harmony,
pleasure, mirth, subtlety: but if ill dignified - folly, dissipation,
waste, silly actions. 

“The Two always represents the Word and the Will. It is the first manifestation.
Therefore, in the suit of Water, it must refer to Love, which recovers unity
from dividuality by mutual annihilation.

The card also refers to Venus in Cancer. Cancer is, more than any other, the
receptive Sign; it is the House of the Moon, and in that Sign Jupiter is exalted.
These are, superficially, the three most friendly of the planets.

The hieroglyph of the card represents two cups in the foreground, overflowing upon a calm sea. They are fed with lucent water from a
lotus floating upon the sea, from which rises another lotus around whose stem
are entwined twin dolphins. The symbolism of the dolphin is very complicated,
and must be studied in books of reference; but the general idea is that of the
“Royal Art”. The dolphin is peculiarly sacred to Alchemy.

The number Two referring to Will, this card might really be renamed the Lord
of Love under Will, for that is its full and true meaning. It shows the harmony
of the male and the female: interpreted in the largest sense. It is perfect and
placid harmony, radiating an intensity of joy and ecstasy.

Of necessity, the realization of the idea in the Four (as the suit develops) will
gradually diminish the purity of its perfection.”

There is romance between them, a sexual attraction. The Two of Cups shows power that is created when two come together. This is the card that lovers want to see, and, in fact, the Two of Cups is the minor arcana equivalent of the Lovers in many ways.  The Two of Cups has a deeper meaning as well. Whenever two forces are drawn together, there is the potential for bonding. This card can stand for the union of any two entities - people, groups, ideas, or talents. In readings, the Two of Cups tells you to look for connections in your life, especially those that are one-on-one. Now is not the time to separate or stay apart. It is the time to join with another and work as a partnership. If you are in conflict, look for truce and the chance to forgive and be forgiven. If you are struggling with two choices or tendencies within yourself, seek to reconcile them. 


Usually, the Two of Cups is welcome in a reading, but it can also sound a note of warning. The energy of Two can be very compelling. They create between themselves a world of their own that can feel exclusionary to outsiders. ""Two's company; three's a crowd."" Make sure that the tendency to pair off is not creating disharmony in your situation.


 Partnerships and unions are represented by the Two of Cups. Much like the Lovers card in the Major Arcana, energies come together to create a mutual bond. Beauty, power, and electric vibrations occur, bringing romance and sexual energy to the scene. Platonic relationships also benefit from the Two of Cups. This is the card that signifies reconciliation. Struggles come to an end, and harmony is restored to even the most hostile of relationships. Inner conflicts also come into play when this card appears. An inner peace is created. Expect to feel strongly connected to others, but also to other entities that bring two together like ideas or talents. 

 this card indicates that pairing off to the exclusion of all other people and situations is happening. Take the time to bring balance into life by including other factors. Unhealthy relationships that consume all one's energy need to be examined, and a new course of action decided upon.

“This card refers to Binah in the suit of Water. This is the card of Demeter or
Persephone. The Cups are pomegranates: they are filled bountifully to overflowing from a single lotus, arising from the dark calm sea characteristic of
Binah. There is here the fulfilment of the Will of Love in abounding joy. It is
the spiritual basis of fertility.

The card is referred to the influence of Mercury in Cancer; this carries further
the above thesis. Mercury is the Will or Word of the All-Father; here its
influence descends upon the most receptive of the Signs.

At the same time, the combination of these forms of energy brings in the
possibility of somewhat mysterious ideas. Binah, the Great Sea, is the Moon in
one aspect, but Saturn in another; and Mercury, besides being the Word or Will
of the All-One, is the guide of the souls of the Dead. This card requires great
subtlety of interpretation. The pomegranate was the fruit which Persephone
ate in the realms of Pluto, thereby enabling him to hold her in the lower world,

“This card refers to Chesed in the sphere of Water. Here, below the Abyss, the
energy of this element, although ordered, balanced and (for the moment)
stabilized, has lost the original purity of the conception.

The card refers to the Moon in Cancer, which is her own house; but Cancer
itself is so placed that this implies a certain weakness, an abandonment to
desire. This tends to introduce the seeds of decay into the fruit of pleasure.

The sea is still shown, but its surface is ruffled, and the four Cups which stand
upon it are no longer so stable. The Lotus from which the water Springs has a
multiple stem, as if to show that the influence of the Dyad has gathered

There is a certain parallelism between this card and the Geomantic figures

“This card is ruled by Geburah in the suit of Water. Geburah being fiery, there is
a natural antipathy. Hence arises the idea of disturbance, just when least
expected, in a time of ease.

The attribution is also to Mars in Scorpio, which is his own house; and Mars is
the manifestation on the lowest plane of Geburah, while Scorpio, in its worst
aspect, suggests the putrefying power of Water. Yet the powerful male
influences do not show actual decay, only the beginning of destruction; hence,
the anticipated pleasure is frustrated. The Lotuses have their petals torn by
fiery winds; the sea is arid and stagnant, a dead sea, like a “chott” in North

“This card shows the influence of the number Six, Tiphareth, in the suit of
Water. This influence is fortified by that of the Sun, who also represents the
Six. The whole image is that of the influence of the Sun on Water. His fierce,
but balanced power operates that type of putrefaction - he is in the Sign of
Scorpio - which is the basis of all fertility, all life.

The lotus stems are grouped in an elaborate dancing movement. From their
blossoms water gushes into the Cups, but they are not yet full to overflowing,
as they are in the corresponding card below; the Nine.

Pleasure, in the title of this card, must be understood in its highest sense: it
implies well-being, harmony of natural forces without effort or strain, ease,
satisfaction. Foreign to the idea of the card is the gratification of natural or
artificial desires. Yet it does represent emphatically the fulfilment of the
sexual Will, as shown by the ruling Sephira, planet, element, and sign.

In the Yi King, Sol in Scorpio is represented by the 20th Hexagram, Kwan,
which is also “Big Earth”, being the Earth Trigram with doubled lines. Kwan
means “manifesting”, but also “contemplating”. The Thwan refers directly to an
High Priest, ceremonially purified, about to present his offerings. The idea of
Pleasure-Putrefaction as a Sacrament is therefore implicit in this Hexagram as
in this card; while the comments on the separate lines by the Duke of Chau
indicate the analytical value of this Eucharist. It is one of the master-keys to
the Gate of Initiation. To realize and to enjoy this fully it is necessary to know,

The six of cups in the esoteric use of the card stands for innocence and nostalgia when it is an upright position. When this card is in a reversed position, it represents the themes of being  stuck in the past, naïve, and unrealistic. Another way it has been interpreted is that it means that it is time to look back to a simpler way of thinking. Unquestionable love is a more modern interpretation.

 The children that are used on the card are there to promote the idea of children being able to hold on to love and to not respond with emotion like adults tend to do.


If the card appears in the reversed position, it indicates a fixation on times which have passed, nostalgia or ruminations on childhood.


The six of cups card can be identified by the six cups that are filled with flowers. The flowers have five points and they are white. Also in the picture, there is an older boy who seems to be smelling the flower while handing it to a younger girl. In the background of the photo, there is a figure walking away from the younger children which appears to be an older person. There is a house and a garden in the background as well. The main color of the image is yellow. Each of these symbols can be interpreted in different ways depending on who is interpreting them. Also there are certain card combinations that, if drawn with the Six of Cups during your reading, the card will be influenced in a certain way.

success gained, but not followed up. Modified as usual by

deception, error; slight success at outset, not retained).

“This card refers to the Seven, Netzach, in the suit of Water. Here recurs the
invariable weakness arising from lack of balance; also, the card is governed by

Venus in Scorpio. Her dignity is not good in this Sign; one is reminded that
Venus is the planet of Copper, “external splendour and internal corruption”.
The Lotuses have become poisonous, looking like tiger-lilies; and, instead of
water, green slime issues from them and overflows, making the Sea a malarious morass. Venus redoubles the influence of the number Seven.

The cups are iridescent, carrying out the same idea.

They are arranged as two descending triangles interlaced above the lowest cup,

reminder of the fatal ease with which a Sacrament may be profaned and

A change or gaining of perspective, this can indicate disillusion with the present, inaugurating the growth of greater future contentment and depth.


This card usually carries the meaning of disillusionment and abandonment of things which have not been emotionally fulfilling.

“The Number Nine, Yesod, in the suit of Water, restores the stability lost by the

The Ruler is Jupiter in Pisces. This influence is more than sympathetic; it is a
definite benediction, for Jupiter is the planet of Chesed which represents
Water in its highest material manifestation, and Pisces brings out the placid
qualities of Water.

In the symbol are nine cups perfectly arranged in a square; all are filled and
overflowing with Water. It is the most complete and most beneficient aspect of

treacherously ambivalent; those of Venus portend rather relief than positive
beneficence; Saturn and Mars are seen at their worst; and even the stable companion
of Laetitia, Acquisitio, has its unpleasant aspects, and even its
dangers. But the consonance of Laetitia with this card amounts to little less
than an identity; the wine is poured by Ganymede himself, unstinted vintage of true nectar of the Gods, brimful and running over, an ordered banquet of

, it can be difficult for tarot novices to differentiate between these two cards as both symbolise emotional happiness. In Tarot there is a direct relationship between cards of the same numeric value because they share the same numerological symbology. The 9 of Cups is directly related to 

, card 9 of the Major Arcana. It therefore has an element of solitude about it. It's a card of emotional happiness and fulfilment which is enjoyed alone. Therefore, the main difference between the Nine and Ten of Cups is that the nine is a card of emotional happiness and fulfilment which is enjoyed alone and the ten is a card of emotional happiness and fulfilment enjoyed collectively (i.e., a family, a community etc.).

“This card represents a conflicting element. On the one hand, it receives the

Nearby, two young children are seen playing. In other decks, the rainbow image is removed and the children are not evident, but in most cases, the cups are arranged upright and a young happy couple is pictured.


The divinatory message is evident in this image, in that it represents fortunate marriage, contentment of the heart, and the perfection of human love and friendship. It can also refer to the town or country where the querent lives. This is one of the most positive cards in the entire Tarot deck. Reversed, it can refer to quarreling, violence, and a troubled heart.

Other divinatory meanings include a peaceful environment and (reversed) a disrupted routine, and selfish exploitation.

Two crossed swords, like the air dagger of a Z.A.M., each
held by a White Radiant Angelic Hand. Upon the point
where the two cross is a rose of five petals, emitting white
rays. At the top and bottom of the card are two small daggers,
supporting respectively the symbol of the Moon thus, and Libra representing the Decanate. 

Contradictory characters in the same nature, strength
through suffering; pleasure after pain. Sacrifice and trouble,
yet strength arising therefrom, symbolized by the position of
the rose, as though the pain itself had brought forth beauty.
Arrangement, peace restored; truce; truth and untruth;
sorrow and sympathy. Aid to the weak; arrangement;
justice, unselfishness; also a tendency to repetition of affronts
on being pardoned; injury when meaning well; given to
petitions; also a want of tact, and asking question of little
moment; talkative. 


. Quarrel made up, yet still some
tension in relations: actions sometimes selfish, sometimes
unselfish. 

“This card is ruled by Chokmah in the Element of Air. This suit, governing all
intellectual manifestations, is always complicated and disordered. It is subject to change as is no other suit. It represents a
general shaking-up, resulting from the conffict of Fire and Water in their
marriage; and proceeds, when Earth appears, to crystallization. But the purity
and exaltation of Chokmah are such that this card manifests the very best idea
possible to the suit. The energy abides above the onslaught of disruption. This
comparative calm is emphasized by the celestial attribution: the Moon in Libra.

The Moon is change, but Nature is peaceful; moreover, Libra represents
balance; between them, they regulate the energy of the Swords.

In the card appear two swords crossed; they are united by a blue rose with five
petals. This rose represents the influence of the Mother, whose harmonizing
influence compounds the latent antagonism native to the suit. The Rose emits
white rays, producing a geometrical pattern that emphasizes the equilibrium
of the symbol.”
","-speaking countries, where the games are largely unknown, Tarot cards came to be utilized primarily for 

A female figure sits blindfolded, as she calmly balances two swords across her shoulders. Behind her is a large body of water and above her is the moon.


The woman's seated position, in combination with the crescent moon, recalls the 

 card, and we find a link as well in this card's representation of the characteristic strength of intuition. The woman's blindfold and the sea show a necessity to rely not on immediate stimuli but on deeper thoughts and feelings, that part of the 

Her seated position, when conceptually paired with the balanced swords and the blindfold, may also recall the 

 card.  Yet here the concept of justice is not one of retribution, but of making decisions that are balanced, moral and that we trust to be harmonious within and without ourselves.


, this card depicts a woman in control.  The scene and the discipline of her pose do more to suggest that she has placed the blindfold on herself, as is done in many cultures, ritualistically, to encourage reliance on the other senses (for example the use of blindfolds in martial arts).  


The woman is blind in her situation, but she is safe, not only unafraid, but centered. She wields powerful weapons, but they are not held in a position that is threatening to her or anyone else.  The moon and the sea reinforce this sense of calm and equanimity.


This is a card of meditation, not of action. The crossed swords point to different possible directions, but for the moment the character is looking inward rather than outward and in the possession of an awesome power that protects her until she finds the direction to apply it.

central sword had struck apart the two others, which were
crossed in the preceding symbol): the central sword cuts
asunder the rose of five petals, which in the previous symbol
grew at the junction of the swords; its petals are falling, and no
white rays issue from it. 

Above and below the central sword are the symbols of Saturn and Libra. 


Disruption, interruption, separation, quarrelling; sowing of
discord and strife, mischief-making, sorrow and tears; yet
mirth in Platonic pleasures; singing, faithfulness in promises,
honesty in money transactions, selfish and dissipated, yet
sometimes generous: deceitful in words and repetitions; the

“Binah, the Great Mother, here rules the realm of Air. This fact involves an
extremely difficult doctrine which must be studied at length in 

. Binah is here not the beneficent Mother completing the Trinity with Kether and
Chokmah. She represents the darkness of the Great Sea.

This is accentuated by the Celestial Lordship of Saturn in Libra.

This card is dark and heavy; it is, so to speak, the womb of Chaos. There is an
intense lurking passion to create, but its children are monsters. This may mean
the supreme transcendence of the natural order. Secrecy is here, and
Perversion.

The symbol represents the great Sword of the Magician, point uppermost; it
cuts the junction of two short curved swords. The
impact has destroyed the rose. In the background, storm broods under
implacable night.”
","Three of Swords (""tre di spade"") from an Italian deck

This card depicts a fundamentally sorrowful experience— tarot readers suggest this may be in the form of a lost relationship, an accidental death, or some other form of not just depression or malaise but deeply emotional sorrow.  When the card appears ""reversed"" in a spread, this is not usually read as meaning the ""opposite"" of sorrow, but rather a sorrow that is somehow mitigated by its circumstances or that is not as bad as it could have been.  It is among the most negative cards within the tarot deck.

with white radiations is reinstated on the point of their
intersection. Above and below, on the points of two small
daggers, are Jupiter and Libra, representing the Decanate. 

Rest from sorrow; yet after and through it. Peace from and

plenty, yet after struggle. Goods of this life; abundance;
modified by dignity as is usual.

(Convalescence, recovery from sickness;
change for the better).

“The number Four, Chesed, is here manifested in the realm of the Intellect.
Chesed refers to Jupiter who rules in Libra in this decanate. The sum of these
symbols is therefore without opposition; hence the card proclaims the idea of
authority in the intellectual world. It is the establishment of dogma, and law
concerning it. It represents a refuge from mental chaos, chosen in an arbitrary
manner. It argues for convention.

The hilts of the four Swords are at the corner of a St. Andrew's cross. Their
shape suggests fixation and rigidity. Their points are sheathed in a rather
large rose of forty-nine petals representing social harmony. Here, too, is
compromise.

Minds too indolent or too cowardly to think out their own problems hail joyfully
this policy of appeasement. As always, the Four is the term; as in this case
there is no true justification for repose, its disturbance by the Five holds no
promise of advance; its static shams go pell-mell into the melting-pot; the issue

is mere mess, usually signalized by foetid stench. But it has to be done!

""The effigy of a knight in the attitude of prayer, at full length upon his tomb."" - 

Vigilance, retreat, solitude, hermit's repose, exile, tomb and coffin. The single sword at the knight's side indicates a singularity of purpose and a great focus in life. Reversed: wise administration, circumspection, economy, avarice, precaution, testament. When ascending this card can mean going into a cocoon like a butterfly, opening up your third eye. Getting in touch with your purpose in life.


It is mostly associated with a peaceful, still place. It reflects withdrawal, getting away and shifting the focus inwardly so that recovery and healing can take place.

“Geburah, as always, produces disruption; but as Venus here rules Aquarius,
weakness rather than excess of strength seems the cause of disaster. The
intellect has been enfeebled by sentiment. The defeat is due to pacifism.
Treachery also may be implied.

The hilts of the swords form the inverted pentagram, always a symbol of
somewhat sinister tendency. Here matters are even worse; none of the hilts
resembles any of the others, and their blades are
crooked or broken. They give the impression of drooping; only the lowest of the
swords points upwards, and this is the least effective of the weapons. The rose
of the previous card has been altogether disintegrated.

The historian is happy to observe two perfect illustrations of the mode of this
card and the last in the birth of the Aeon of (I) Osiris, (2) Horus. He will note
the decay of such Virtue as char acterized Sparta and Rome, ending in the
establishment of the Pax Romana. As Virtue declined, corruption disintegrated
the Empire from within. Epicene cults, such as those of Dionysus (in its
degraded form), of Attis, of Adonis, of Cybele, the false Demeter and the
prostituted Isis, replaced the sterner rites of the true Solar- Phallic gods; until
finally (the masters having lost the respect, and so the control, of the plebs,
native and alien) the lowest of all the slave-cults, dressed up in the fables of
the vilest of the parasitic races, swept over the known world, and drenched it

The Rose of the previous symbols of this suit is held up by
the same hand which holds the central sword: as if the victory

Partial success. Yielding when victory is within grasp, as 
if the last reserves of strength were used up. Inclination to
lose when on the point of gaining, through not continuing
the effort. Love of abundance, fascinated by display, given
to compliments, affronts and insolences, and to spy upon
others. Inclined to betray confidences, not always intentionally.
Rather vacillatory and unreliable. 
 

“Netzach, in the suit of Swords, does not represent such catastrophe as in the
other suits, for Netzach, the Sephira of Venus, means victory. There is,
therefore, a modifying influence; and this is accentuated by the celestial rule
of the Moon in Aquarius.

The intellectual wreckage of the card is thus not so vehement as in the Five.
There is vacillation, a wish to compromise, a certain toleration. But, in certain
circumstances, the results may be more disastrous than ever. This naturally
depends upon the success of the policy. This is always in doubt as long as there
exist violent, uncompromising forces which take it as a natural prey.

This card, like the Four, suggests the policy of appeasement.

The symbol shows six Swords with their hilts in crescent formation. Their points
meet below the centre of the card, impinging upon a blade of a much larger
up-thrusting sword, as if there were a contest between the many feeble and
the one strong. He strives in vain.”

A hasty decision, greed and/or thoughtless behavior, the individual acts in an impulsive fashion. It represents secret plans, hidden dishonor, frustration and the possibility of failure.


The Seven of Swords, when upright, means to use your wits for diplomacy and not to use aggression. This is why it can be viewed as secret planning or hidden dishonor.  Your acts may be legitimate.  However, you prefer to use your mind and intellect rather than force or via obvious means.


The Reversed meaning of the card means excess use of intellect with little success on an outcome, to surrender, or to have little care on solving a problem. The questioner needs to break away from ingrained habits or ways to approach problems.


The figure is taking stealthy steps, looking back to examine the scene he is leaving. Apparently he is doing something he knows he should not be doing, and is attempting to get away with it anyway.

“The number Nine, Yesod, brings back the Energy to the central pillar of the
Tree of Life. The previous disorder is now rectified.

But the general idea of the suit has been constantly degenerating. The Swords
no longer represent pure intellect so much as the automatic stirring of
heartless passions. Consciousness has fallen into a realm unenlightened by
reason. This is the world of the unconscious primitive instincts, of the
psychopath, of the fanatic.

The celestial ruler is Mars in Gemini, crude rage of hunger operating without
restraint; although its form is intellectual, it is the temper of the inquisitor.

The symbol shows nine swords of varying lengths, all striking downwards to a
point. They are jagged and rusty. Poison and blood drip from their blades.

There is, however, a way of dealing with this card: the way of passive
resistance, resignation, the acceptance of martyrdom.

Nor is an alien formula that of implacable revenge.”
",", also known as the Lord of Cruelty. In many countries around 

 it is used as a game card. This card has the numerical value of nine.


In many countries Tarot cards are believed to tell the future, or have a divination usage. In these countries it is a very negative sign to have this card be turned. It is believed that it being turned can be instigated by others, as it might be coming up to show that one has been cruel to someone nearby.
The first ever card was made in 1776 by Dr James Porter.


This card has a lot to do with someone's mind and their doubts and pain. The card shows a person, most often a woman, lying down or sitting up but they are or were sleeping. When this card is reversed it can be about real or imagined doubts or pain, just as dreams can be about real or imagined parts of our life. Most often the person on the card is on a bridge symbolizing a person between the worlds of dreaming and reality or also the worlds of life and death.


Above the person lies their fears, hanging above them in an airy or dreamy way; this can be represented through demons, devils or even a heavily agitated night sky. Often there are sharp objects such as swords or knives, representing that a persons fears may pierce or stab through them.  The swords could also mean that they are there to help the person cut through their own difficulties.


If this card is shown in an upright position, it can mean deception, premonitions and bad dreams, suffering and depression, cruelty, disappointment, violence, loss and scandal. However, all of these may be overcome through faith and calculated inaction. This is the card of the martyr and with it comes new life out of suffering.


This card can represent being plagued by fear, guilt, doubt, and worries that are to a large extent, unfounded. Chances are the person in question is dealing with a problematic situation or a difficult decision, but his or her worst fear is unlikely to materialize.


If the card is shown in an ill-dignified or reversed manner then it has a different meaning. When turned this way it means distrust, suspicion, despair, misery or malice. Total isolation away from comfort and help: institutionalization, suicide, imprisonment and isolation. However, in a generally positive spread, the reversed meaning of this card can also indicate that the nightmare may be ending. The Nine of Swords reversed can actually be a hopeful card, counseling faith in the future and the promise of better days ahead.

symbol; the points falling away from each other. Two
hands hold two swords crossed in the centre, as though their
junction had disunited the others. No rose, flower or bud,
is shewn. Above and below are the Sun and Gemini, representing the
Decan. 

Almost a worse symbol than the Nine of Swords. Undisciplined,
warring force, complete disruption and failure.
Ruin of all plans and projects. Disdain, insolence and impertinence,
yet mirth and jollity therewith. A marplot, loving
to overthrow the happiness of others; a repeater of things;
given to much unprofitable speech, and of many words. Yet
clever, eloquent, etc., according to dignity. 


“The number Ten, Malkuth, as always, represents the culmination of the
unmitigated energy of the idea. It shows reason run mad, ramshackle riot of
soulless mechanism; it represents the logic of lunatics and (for the most part)
of philosophers. It is reason divorced from reality.

The card is also ruled by the Sun in Gemini, but the mercurial airy quality of
the Sign serves to disperse his rays; this card shows the disruption and disorder
of harmonious and stable energy.

The hilts of the Swords occupy the positions of the Sephiroth, but the points
One to Five and Seven to Nine touch and shatter the central Sword (six) which
represents the Sun, the Heart, the child
of Chokmah and Binah. The tenth Sword is also in splinters. It is the ruin of the
Intellect, and even of all mental and moral qualities.


In the Yi King, Sol in Gemini is the virtue of the 43rd Hexagram, Kwai, the
Watery modification of the Phallus; also, by the interlacing interpretation, the
harmony of these two same Trigrams.

The signification is perfectly harmonious with that of the Ten of swords. It
represents the damping down of the Creative impulse, weakness, corruption, or
mirage affecting that principle itself. But, viewing the Hexagram as a weapon
or method of procedure, it counsels the ruler to purge the state of unworthy
officers. Curiously, the invention of written characters to replace knotted
strings is ascribed among Chinese scholars to the use of this hexagram by the
sages. Gemini is ruled by Thoth; 10 is the key of the Naples Arrangement; and
Apollo (Sol) is the patron of literature and the arts: so his suggestion might
appear at least no less suitable to the Qabalistic correspondences than to their
double emphasis on Water and the Sun.

Apart from this, however, the parallelism is complete.

In the upright or positive light, the ten of swords represents destruction, being pinned down by a multitude of things or situations. The person lying on the ground, defeated and bleeding, may also represent a feeling of hopelessness and being trapped by emotions or mental anguish, since 

Dark clouds hovering above the person signify despair and a bleak situation. However, upon closer examination of the images in the 

 card, any death or destruction, like all things, may not be permanent. There is hope in spite of the situation; the golden sky in the distance suggests that the current situation is bad, and things will improve.


In the reversed state, the card indicates a troubling situation that will continue for a significant amount of time. The card suggests that the subject should not despair in difficult times, to avoid ruining future prospects for success.

“The Four, Chesed, shows the establishment of the Universe in three
dimensions, that is, below the Abyss. The generating idea is exhibited in its full
material sense. The card is ruled by the Sun in Capricornus, the Sign in which
he is reborn. The disks are very large and solid; the suggestion of the card is
that of a fortress. This represents Law and Order, maintained by constant

authority and vigilance. The disks themselves are square; revolution is very
opposite to the card; and they contain the signs of the Four Elements. For all
that, they revolve; defence is valid only when violently active. So far as it
appears stationary, it is the “dead centre” of the engineer; and Capricornus is

it. Womb - possibly a softened form?

an enclosed and fortified space. Case, castle, chest, cyst, chaste, incest and so
on.

The primary radicle in all this class of words is the guttural. Observe the

to upset Taurus; so the natural meaning is Intelligence applied to Labour.

The symbol represents five disks in the form of the inverted Pentagram,
instability in the very foundations of Matter. The effect is that of an
earthquake. They are, however, representative of the five Tatvas; these hold

The church windows imply charities and hopes, difficult to satisfy, but still worth fighting for. The right figure pictured isn't obviously friend or foe to the man on crutches, suggesting an uncertain relation. Obviously someone is in need of help, and you will be either drawn or repelled by someone or something in slow degrees. The bell around the  crippled man's neck means the issue is insistent, and though you may want to ignore it, you should not, cannot, because ignoring only worsens a problem of severity. In medieval times, lepers were made to wear a bell around their neck to warn others of their approach so people could avoid them.

The Five of Coins, or the Five of Pentacles is a card when upright means to lose all faith, losing resources, losing a lover (mostly shows up when you've had a breakup), and losing security whether financially or emotionally (or both).


The Reversed meaning of the card is when hope returns slowly but surely, you can be positive from the troubles you've recently experienced, mostly shows up when you are back into a relationship again that was once broken, a renewal of faith. The advice of the card is to see a glass as half full not half empty, to seek help when you need it and not fear rejection.

without the Maltese cross and wings. They are arranged like

Over-careful in small things at the expense of great:
“Penny wise and pound foolish”: gain of ready money in small
sums; mean; avaricious; industrious; cultivation of land;
hoarding, lacking in enterprise.

Mercury in his most spiritual aspect, and he both rules
and is exalted in the sign of Virgo, which belongs to the Decan, and is governed
by the Sun. It signifies intelligence lovingly applied to material matters,
especially those of the agriculturalist, the artificer and the engineer.

lowest fallen and therefore the highest exalted. These last three cards seem to

produced by the exhaustion of all the elemental forces. At the end of matter

Among the Geomantic figures, Mercury in Virgo is Conjunctio. The meaning, conjunction, is shown plainly by the attraction of the
descending (female) Triangle, the cipher of the Yoni, to the ascending (male)
Triangle, that of the Lingam. This union completed, they appear interlaced, forming the figure of Capricornus, the Sign

“The first and most obvious characteristic of this card is that it comes at the end of all, and is therefore the complement of the Fool. It is attributed to the letter Tau. The two cards together accordingly spell the word Ath, which means Essence. All reality is consequently compromised in the series of which these two letters form the begin ning and the end. This beginning was Nothing; the end must there fore be also Nothing, but Nothing in its complete expansion, as pre viously explained. The number 4, rather than the number 2, was ehosen as the basis of this expansion, partly no doubt for convenience, to enlarge the ""universe of discourse""; partly to emphasize the idea of limitation...

...The letter Tau means the Sign of the Cross, that is, of extension; and this extension is symbolized as four-fold because of the convenience of constructing the revolving symbol of Tetragrammaton. In the case of the number 2, the only issue is the return to the unity or to the negative. No continuous process can be conveniently symbolized; but the number 4 lends itself, not only to this rigid extension, the hard facts of nature, but also to the transcendence of space and time by a continuously self-compensating change.

The letter Tau is attributed to Saturn, the outermost and slowest of the seven sacred planets; because of these dull, heavy qualities, the element of earth was thrust upon the symbol. The original three elements, Fire, Air, Water, sufficed for primitive thought; Earth and Spirit represent a later accretion. Neither is to be found in the original twenty-two Paths of the Sepher Yetzirah. The world of Assiah, the material world, does not appear except as a pendant to the Tree of Life.

In the same way, the element of Spirit is attributed to the letter 

, as an additional ornament, somewhat in the same way as Kether is said to be symbolized by the topmost point of the Yod of Tetragrammaton. It is constantly necessary to distinguish between the symbols of philosophical theory and those more elaborate symbols based upon them which are necessary in practical work.


Saturn and Earth have certain qualities in common-heaviness, coldness, dryness, immobility, dulness and the like. Yet Saturn appears in Binah in respect of its blackness in the Queen's scale, which is the scale of Observed Nature; but always, as soon as the end of a process is reached, it returns automatically to the beginning.


In Chemistry, it is the heaviest elements that are unable in terrestrial conditions to support the strain and stress of their internal structure; consequently, they radiate particles of the most tenuous character and the highest activity. In an essay written in Cefalu, Sicily, on the second law of Thermo-dynamics, it was suggested that at the absolute zero of the air thermometer, an element heavier than uranium might exist, of such a nature that it was capable of reconstituting the entire series of elements. It was a chemical interpretation of the equation, 0=2.


It becomes then reasonable to argue from analogy that since the end must beget the beginning, the symbolism will follow; hence, blackness is also attributed to the sun, according to a certain long- hidden tradition. One of the shocks for candidates in the ""Mysteries"" was the revelation ""Osiris is a black god"".


Saturn, therefore, is masculine; he is the old god, the god of fertility) the sun in the south; but equally the Great Sea, the great Mother; and the letter Tau upon the Tree of Life appears as an emana tion from the moon of Yesod, the foundation of the Tree and repre sentative of the reproductive process and of the equilibrium between change and stability, or rather their identification. The influence of the path descends upon the earth, Malkuth, the daughter. Here again appears the doctrine of  ""setting the daughter upon the throne of the Mother"". In the card itself there is consequently a glyph of the completion of the Great Work in its highest sense, exactly as the Atu of the Fool symbolizes its beginning. The Fool is the negative issuing into manifestation; the Universe is that manifestation, its purpose accomplished, ready to return. The twenty cards that lie between these two exhibit the Great Work and its agents in various stages. The image of the Universe in this sense is accordingly that of a maiden, the final letter of Tetragrammaton.


In the present card she is represented as a dancing figure. In her hands she manipulates the radiant spiral force, the active and passive, each possessing its dual polarity. iler dancing partner is shown as Heru-Ra-Ha of Atu XIX. ""The Sun, Strength & Sight, Light; these are for the servants of the Star & the Snake."" This final form of the image of the Magical Formula of the God combines and trans forms so many symbols that description is difficult, and would be nugatory. The proper method of study of this card-indeed of all, but of this especially-is long-continued meditation. The Universe, so states the theme, is the Celebration of the Great Work accomplished. In the corners of the card are the four Kerubim showing the established Universe; and about her is an ellipse composed of seventy- two circles for the quinaries of the Zodiac, the Shemhamphorasch.


In the centre of the lower part of the card is represented the skeleton plan of the building of the house of Matter. It shews the ninety-two known chemical elements, arranged according to their rank in the hierarchy. (The design is due o the genius of the late J. W. N. Sullivan: see 


In the centre, a wheel of Light initiates the form of the Tree of Life, shewing the ten principal bodies of the solar system. But this Tree is not visible except to those of wholly pure heart.


I. The primum mobile, represented by Pluto. (Compare the doctrine of the alpha particles of radium.)

2. The sphere of the Zodiac or fixed stars, represented by Neptune.


The Abyss. This is represented by Herschel, the planet of disintegration and explosion.


All these symbols swim and dance in a complex but continuous ambience of loops and whorls. The general colour of the traditional card is subfuse; it represents the confusion and darkness of the material world. But the New Aeon has brought fullness of Light; in the Minutum Mundum, Earth is no longer black, or of mixed colours, but is pure bright green. Similarly, the indigo of Saturn is derived from the blue velvet of the midnight sky, and the maiden of the dance represents the issue from this, yet through this, to the Eternal. This card is today as bright and glowing as any in the Pack.”"," deck. It is the final card of the Major Arcana or tarot trump sequence.
